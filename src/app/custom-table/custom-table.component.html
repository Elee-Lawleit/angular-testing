<div class="mat-elevation-z8">
  <!-- Also, you can kind of invert your thinking here, instead of defining each row and then tds inside them, we are defining tds and THEN defininf rows at the bottom. And they are not inside of each other so yea that too -->

  <!-- okay, so this is basically the entire parent table tag that's going to contain everything -->
  <!-- and you can also see the matSort directive which helps in applying sorting -->
  <table mat-table class="full-width-table" matSort aria-label="Elements">
    <!-- Id Column -->

    <!-- we need to define containers for holding each column field, and then give it the columnDef aka the unique column name -->
    <ng-container matColumnDef="id">
      <!-- this mart-sort-header deals with how the arrow is displayed I believe, also this is the header part, like, the heading part of the column -->
      <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef mat-sort-header>Id</th>

      <!-- and then this is the actual data and stuff, we also add anything in here -->
      <td mat-cell *matCellDef="let row">{{ row.id }}</td>
    </ng-container>

    <!-- Name Column -->

    <!-- same as above, although I DO NEED TO LOOK INTO ng-template and ng-container MORE AND STUDY THEM -->
    <ng-container matColumnDef="name">
      <th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef mat-sort-header>Name</th>
      <td mat-cell *matCellDef="let row">{{ row.name }}</td>

    <!-- these are the row tags, basically we are defining header row and then below, we are also defining the normal rows -->
    <!-- don't need to loop the header array to only displaying it once -->
    <tr mat-header-row *matHeaderRowDef="displayedColumns"></tr>
    <!-- this *matRowDef thingy is actually going to loop through the array and display this row as many times as needed -->
    <tr mat-row *matRowDef="let row; columns: displayedColumns"></tr>
  </table>

  <!-- and this is just the paginator that's being attached -->

  <!-- the paginator is kind of detached here but it is being attached to the table's datasource in the TypeScript file -->
  <!-- using the @ViewChild decorator, also this is realy easy to configure-->
  <mat-paginator
    #paginator
    [length]="dataSource.data.length"
